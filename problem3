//Anne is using a calorie tracker app that helps her keep a record of all her physical activities and her daily intake of calories The calories burned by her doing some 
of the common physical activities are:

30 minutes of cycling burns around 300 calories
30 minutes of swimming burns around 200 calories
30 minutes of running burns around 500 calories
Anne can lose one pound of weight for each 1000 calories burned. Her daily extra calorie intake tracked by the app is 100 Write a java program to calculate 
the number of pounds Anne can lose in a month if she does each of the above mentioned activities once a week for 1 hour and chooses to do one activity per day.

							+ caloriesBurnedForSwimming
